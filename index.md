## Brainstorming for Quarter 2 Project Proposal  

**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
All in all everything that we covered in this quarter was interesting to me in one way or another, but the most interesting was definetly using NLP. I find NLP fascinating because it connects human language with machine understanding in such a natural way. It’s amazing to see how tools like chatbots and translators can make technology feel so intuitive. I love how it combines linguistics, data, and AI to unlock endless possibilities in understanding communication.

**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
For my Quarter 2 Project, I’d like to investigate how transformer models, such as BERT for DNA, can predict the functional impact of genetic mutations. By training on genomic sequence data, the goal would be to identify patterns associated with regulatory elements or disease-linked mutations. This investigation could also explore visualizing the learned representations (e.g., sequence logos) to better understand how the model interprets biological features, providing insights into both model performance and biological significance.

**3. What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
A potential change that I would've taken in my current approach of my Quarter 1 project would be using other browsers that were extremely useful for showcasing our data visualization, such as UCSC Genome browser etc... I do plan on trying to use this browser for my next project, to make the visaulizations look more professional.

**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
I’m interested in using transformer models (e.g., BERT) for analyzing DNA or protein sequences, clustering algorithms for grouping genetic data, and network analysis for studying interactions in systems biology. Visualization tools like sequence logos and unsupervised learning for uncovering hidden patterns could add depth and clarity to the project.Apart from using UCSC Genome browser in the upcoming project, I would also like to use more
